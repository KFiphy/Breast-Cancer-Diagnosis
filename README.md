# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis


In this dataset, we will analyse and predict the diagnosis of breast cancer based on the symptoms available in the data. This is a labeled data and a binary classification. Hence, the use of classification Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms. The best model are not known. So, we will check the performance of two and proceed with cross validation for deciding best model. We will also extend towards GridSerchCv to find the best parameters for our chosen model.

The folowing models will be put into consideration ;
Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression,
