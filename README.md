# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis


In this dataset, we will analyse and predict the diagnosis of breast cancer based on the result of a mammogram screening. The dataset employed for this project is labelled and binary classified. Hence, the use of classification Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms. Few algorithms are selected for training and the best-performed model would be identified through cross-validation. A further extension is applying GridSearchCv to find the optimal set of parameters for the chosen model. The estimator is then applied on the test set for prediction, and evaluated using accuracy and other metrics.

The following models will be put into consideration ;
Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, K Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression.
