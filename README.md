# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis


In this dataset, we will analyse and predict the diagnosis of breast cancer based on the result of the mammogram. This is labelled data and a binary classification. Hence, the use of classification Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms. Few algorithms are selected for training and two best-performed models would be identified from them. Afterwards, the performance of the two models are cross-validated to decide on a single model. A further extension is applying GridSearchCv to find the optimal set of parameters for the chosen model. The estimator is then applied on the test set for prediction, and evaluated using accuracy and other metrics.

The folowing models will be put into consideration ;
Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression,
